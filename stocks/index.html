        <h1>Stock Highs Per Month in 2018</h1>
        <div>
          <p>Here I have five separate graphs displaying the 2018 year month by month highs for five different companies.<br> I've chosen Advanced Auto Parts, Amazon, Dicks Sporting Goods, Ford Motor Company, and Microsoft.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>Advanced Auto Parts</h1>
          <img src="AAP.png">

          <h1>Amazon</h1>
          <img src="AMZN.png">

          <h1>Dicks Sporting Goods</h1>

          <h1>Ford Motor Company</h1>

          <h1>Conclusion</h1>
          <p>After reviewing the stocks and analyzing the data from the bar graphs, I've concluded that all five companies have had a solid year regarding the stock valuation. <br>Of the five, only Ford Motor Company has seen their stock high for each month lower as the year has progressed.<br> Dicks Sporting Goods and Microsoft seem to be enjoying the most consistent year, while Advanced Auto Parts and Amazon have both seen steady increases as the year has gone on.<br> With all that being said, I believe the best stock to invest in would be Amazon.</p>
