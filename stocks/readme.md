Discovery / Requirements

Obtained data from https://www.alphavantage.co/. I used the monthly data for five stocks high each month in 2018.


Collection Phase

Downloaded the CSV file for Advanced Auto Parts, Amazon, Dicks Sporting Goods, Ford Motor Company, and Microsoft.


Data Prep / Cleaning

Altered the CVS file to only include the 2018 year stock numbers.


Exploration/Planning

No missing data.


Modeling/Algorithms

Used python's matplotlib to graph the data.


Automation / Computation

Analyzed the data from the CSV file and used matplotlib to create the bar graph displaying the stock highs for each month in 2018.


Review

All data imported on to bar graphs correctly.
